# BuildPulse Example Project: Python + pytest

This is an example [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) project demonstrating how to send test results to [BuildPulse](https://buildpulse.io) to help you detect, track, and eliminate flaky tests.

## CircleCI Integration

If you have an existing pytest project building on CircleCI, this [diff](https://github.com/buildpulse/buildpulse-example-pytest/compare/pre-buildpulse...circle-ci) shows how to set up your `.circleci/config.yml` to send test results to BuildPulse.

## GitHub Actions CI Integration

If you have an existing pytest project building on GitHub Actions CI, this [diff](https://github.com/buildpulse/buildpulse-example-pytest/compare/pre-buildpulse...github-actions) shows how to set up your GitHub Actions workflow to send test results to BuildPulse.
